# Chat Reporting is a Terrible Idea - the mod
for 22w24a - a mod showcase

## Why?
In 22w24a, Mojang added the ability to report chat messages using the "Social Interactions" menu.
I believe that chat moderation should be up to the server owner, but just to drive the point home, I made this mod.
### What does it do?
It's simple - it keeps track of which players it has reported during the current game session. When a new player talks in chat,
it reports the chat message, automatically, for "Profanity."
